/**
 * Finds the shortest distance between two nodes using the A-star (A*) algorithm
 * @param graph an adjacency-matrix-representation of the graph where (x,y) is the weight of the edge or 0 if there is no edge.
 * @param heuristic an estimation of distance from node x to y that is guaranteed to be lower than the actual distance. E.g. straight-line distance
 * @param start the node to start from.
 * @param goal the node we're searching for
 * @return The shortest distance to the goal node. Can be easily modified to return the path.
