 * @param {Array} polygon an array representation of the polygon where polygon[i][0] is the x Value of the i-th point and polygon[i][1] is the y Value.
 * @param {Array} point   an array representation of the point where point[0] is its x Value and point[1] is its y Value
 * @return {boolean} whether the point is in the polygon (not on the edge, just turn < into <= and > into >= for that)
